# Evo.Blazor.Canvases
A blazor library that makes it easier to write to the canvas

# Learning

I found it is not only useful to document and keep track of the final solution, but how one got there.  For the first couple of days working on this project I had to learn a lot about canvases and still have a long way to go.   To help others stumble less, and for me to be able to keep track of where I got information, here are the links I found useful:

- [WebGL Anti-Patterns](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-anti-patterns.html) - This link helped a ton.  It explained some important concepts and how to best resize the canvas and when window or other changes in the page cause the canvas to resize.  Thank you!
